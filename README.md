# Musical-Track-Database
This is to help those who are stuck  in week 3's assignment of the Course "Using Database with Python" by Dr. Chuck


I got the following result: 
1.For Those About To Rock (We Salute You) AC/DC Who Made Who Rock ,
2.Hells Bells AC/DC Who Made Who Rock,
3.Shake Your Foundations AC/DC Who Made Who Rock


The expected result shows a different result when the given query was executed. Altough, when submitted,it shows correct answer and score was saved. I guess his playlist is updated .
